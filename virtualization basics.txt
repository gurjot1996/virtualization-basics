Virtualization is a concept quite different than what cloud computing is rather it is a subset of what cloud computing is.

it basically separates the operating system from the underlying hardware with the help of a hypervisor 

hypervisoror a virtual machine monitor 
"A hypervisor or virtual machine monitor (VMM) is computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and 
runs virtual machines. A computer on 
which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines is called a host machine, and each virtual machine is called a guest machine."

type1 - a computer with hypervisor installed then os(bare metal)
type2 - a computer with some os installed hyper visor is installed onto then other os can be installed on this hypervisor installed in the
native os.


in type hypervisor is installed onto the hardware and its gui shows computer info processor ram etc we need management console
management software manages the os and the servers on/off
overallocation-
giving more ram to os than available
hypervisor does the entire virtual ram allocation
windows,xen(linux)
vmware citrix chaqrge for management software
 

type 2 hypervisor
computer with os installed 
hypervisor is installed on this os
management softw is not need in such a situation
virtualbox,vmware
resouce alloctaion must be done wisely because the machine even not working would take up the ram allocated to it
